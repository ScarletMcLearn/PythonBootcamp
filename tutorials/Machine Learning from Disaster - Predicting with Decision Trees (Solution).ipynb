Once a variable is chosen, you do the split and go down one level (or one node) and repeat. The final nodes at the bottom of the decision tree are known as terminal nodes, and the majority vote of the observations in that node determine how to predict for new observations that end up in that terminal node.\n",

    "## A Random Forest analysis in Python\n",
    "A detailed study of Random Forests would take this tutorial a bit too far. However, since it's an often used machine learning technique, gaining a general understanding in Python won't hurt.\n",
    "\n",
    "In layman's terms, the Random Forest technique handles the overfitting problem you faced with decision trees. It grows multiple (very deep) classification trees using the training set. At the time of prediction, each tree is used to come up with a prediction and every outcome is counted as a vote. For example, if you have trained 3 trees with 2 saying a passenger in the test set will survive and 1 says he will not, the passenger will be classified as a survivor. This approach of overtraining trees, but having the majority's vote count as the actual classification decision, avoids overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building a random forest in Python looks almost the same as building a decision tree; so we can jump right to it. There are two key differences, however. Firstly, a different class is used. And second, a new argument is necessary. Also, we need to import the necessary library from scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use <b>RandomForestClassifier()</b> class instead of the <b>DecisionTreeClassifier()</b> class.\n",
    "- <b>n_estimators</b> needs to be set when using the <b>RandomForestClassifier()</b> class. This argument allows you to set the number of trees you wish to plant and average over.\n",
